# ⭐️ StarExplorer
This is a demo application designed to showcase transactions using the Telegram star-based currency for a specific bot. It leverages the [typescript-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/Borodin/typescript-telegram-bot-api) to fetch data from the `.getStarTransactions()` method and display it in a list format.

## How to Use
To use this application, you will need a bot token, which you can obtain from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

1. Visit the [StarExplorer demo](https://borodin.github.io/StarExplorer/).
2. Enter your bot token in the provided field.
3. View the transactions displayed.

## Security
Your bot token is used only to interact with the Telegram API (`api.telegram.org`) and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere. The entire source code is available in this repository for verification.
